# Cracking the Coding Interview

Quit recently I have been reading [Cracking the coding interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) a great book I recommend for anyone interested in improving their coding skills and who need to prepare for a technical interview. I thought I would create a git which links to some of my solutions. I often try if not too long to implement the structure the chapter is about in C. Then I try solving the exercise either in C or Python.
Hence, some of the code there is not 100% mine. I sometimes had a first look on the internet on how to implement some data structures and then tried implementing them on my own hence please forgive me if you find some similarities. Moreover, some of the exercises required premade structures. Hence, I brorrowed some frome different places.

I hope you find this repo usefull.
